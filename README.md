# Exercise - Configure a resource lock

This exercise demonstrates how to create a resource in Azure and configure a resource lock. A storage account is used as an example since it provides one of the clearest ways to observe the impact of locks.

Users with an Azure subscription can follow the steps below. Those without a subscription can still review the process to understand how resource locks work.

## Task 1: Create a resource

Before applying a resource lock, an Azure resource must exist. In this case, the resource will be a storage account.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Select **Create a resource**.
3. Under **Categories**, choose **Storage**.
4. Select **Storage Account** ‚Üí **Create**.
5. On the **Basics** tab, complete the following fields (leave defaults for the rest):

   | Setting              | Value                                 |
   |----------------------|---------------------------------------|
   | Resource group       | Create new                            |
   | Storage account name | Provide a unique name                 |
   | Location             | Choose an available region            |
   | Performance          | Standard                              |
   | Redundancy           | Locally redundant storage (LRS)       |

6. Select **Review + Create** and then **Create**.
7. Once deployment completes, select **Go to resource**.

## Task 2: Apply a read-only resource lock

Next, a read-only lock is applied to the storage account.

1. In the left-hand menu, scroll down to **Settings**.
2. Select **Locks** ‚Üí **+ Add**.
3. Enter a name for the lock.
4. Set **Lock type** = **Read-only**.
5. Select **OK**.

## Task 3: Add a container to the storage account

The next step is to try adding a container to see the effect of the lock.

1. Under **Data storage**, select **Containers**.
2. Select **+ Container**.
3. Enter a container name ‚Üí **Create**.

An error message will appear:
> [!WARNING]
> *Failed to create storage container.*

![Failed to create container error screenshot](path/to/failed-create-container.png)

This occurs because the **read-only lock** blocks any create or update operations.

## Task 4: Modify the resource lock and create a storage container

To proceed, the lock type must be changed.

1. Go back to **Settings > Locks**.
2. Select the existing lock and change **Lock type** ‚Üí **Delete** ‚Üí **OK**.

3. Return to **Data storage > Containers**.
4. Select **+ Container**, enter a name ‚Üí **Create**.

‚úÖ The container should now be created successfully.

## Task 5: Delete the storage account

Now, attempt to delete the storage account.

1. Go to the **Overview** page.
2. Select **Delete**.

A notification will appear:
> [!WARNING]
> *You can't delete the resource because it has a delete lock.*

## Task 6: Remove the delete lock and delete the storage account

Finally, the delete lock is removed and the storage account is cleaned up.

1. Go to **Settings > Locks**.
2. Remove the existing delete lock.
3. Navigate back to **Home > Storage accounts**.
4. Select the storage account ‚Üí **Delete**.
5. Confirm by typing the storage account name and select **Delete**.

‚úÖ A confirmation message should appear, confirming the storage account was deleted.

## üéâ Congratulations!

This exercise walked through the full process of creating a resource, applying a lock, testing its restrictions, modifying it, and finally removing it to delete the resource.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**
Be sure to complete Task 6 and remove the storage account. Users are responsible for any resources in their Azure subscription, so it‚Äôs essential to clean up after completing the exercise.
